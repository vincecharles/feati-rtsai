# Role-Based Authorization System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive role-based authorization and permission system for the FEATI RTSAI platform with support for violation levels, department-based filtering, and granular access control.

## Components Implemented

### 1. **Middleware Layer**

#### CheckRole Middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/CheckRole.php`)
- Simple role-based validation
- Checks if user has specific role
- Returns 403 if unauthorized

#### CheckPermission Middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/CheckPermission.php`)
- Advanced permission-based authorization
- Supports role-based and department-based permissions
- Permission matrix:
  - **Super Admin**: `super_admin`, `view_all_violations`, `view_all_reports`, `manage_all_employees`
  - **Security**: `security`, `create_violation`, `edit_own_violations`, `view_violations`
  - **Department Head**: `dept_head`, `view_department`, `manage_department_employees`, `view_department_violations`
  - **OSA**: `osa`, `create_violation`, `edit_violation`, `view_violations`, `resolve_violations`
  - **Teacher**: `teacher`, `view_own_profile`

#### Registration in Bootstrap
- Registered in `bootstrap/app.php` with aliases:
  - `check.role` → CheckRole middleware
  - `check.permission` → CheckPermission middleware

### 2. **Controller Updates**

#### ReportsController (`app/Http/Controllers/ReportsController.php`)
Updated `getOverviewStatistics()` method with role-based filtering:
- **Super Admin**: Sees all statistics (students, employees, violations)
- **Department Head**: Sees only their department's statistics
- **OSA/Security**: Sees violations-related statistics only
- **Others**: No data access (returns zeros)

#### ViolationController (`app/Http/Controllers/ViolationController.php`)
Updated `index()` method:
- Added role-based filtering for department heads
- Department heads can only see violations for their department's students
- Teachers cannot access violations list
- Added `level` field to validation rules in both `store()` and `update()`
- Included `level` in violation creation and updates
- Added level filter support

#### EmployeeController (`app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php`)
Updated `index()` method:
- Department heads can only see employees in their department
- Teachers cannot view employee list
- Super Admin sees all employees

### 3. **Model Updates**

#### EmployeeProfile (`app/Models/EmployeeProfile.php`)
- Added `department` to fillable array
- Added `position` to fillable array
- Enables department-based filtering and role differentiation

#### Violation (`app/Models/Violation.php`)
- Already has `level` in fillable array
- Supports Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Expulsion levels

### 4. **View Updates**

#### Violations Index View (`resources/views/violations/index.blade.php`)
Enhanced with:
- New **Level** filter dropdown (All Levels, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Expulsion)
- New **Level** column in violations table (6 columns total now)
- Color-coded level badges:
  - Level 1: Blue (`bg-blue-100`)
  - Level 2: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100`)
  - Level 3: Orange (`bg-orange-100`)
  - Expulsion: Red (`bg-red-100`)
- Updated filter grid from 5 to 6 columns

#### Violations Create Form (`resources/views/violations/create.blade.php`)
- Level field with 4 options and descriptions
- Positioned after violation_type field

#### Violations Edit Form (`resources/views/violations/edit.blade.php`)
- Level field matching create form structure
- Uses `old('level', $violation->level)` for form repopulation

## Database Schema

### Migrations Applied
1. **2025_10_22_000000_add_department_and_position_to_employee_profiles**
   - Added `department` column (string)
   - Added `position` column (string)

2. **2025_10_22_000001_add_level_to_violations_table**
   - Added `level` column (enum: 'Level 1', 'Level 2', 'Level 3', 'Expulsion')

### Test Data
- **100 Employees** properly distributed:
  - 1 Super Admin (Melanie Flores)
  - 15 Security staff
  - 3 OSA staff
  - 6 Department Heads (one per college/school)
  - 17 Program Chairs (distributed by college)
  - ~40 Teachers

- **200 Students** across 8 programs with year levels (1st-4th)

- **20+ Violations** with all levels represented

## Permission Matrix Summary

| Role | View All Violations | View Dept Violations | View All Stats | View Dept Stats | Create Violations | Edit Violations | Manage Department |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Super Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Department Head | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OSA | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Security | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Limited | ❌ |
| Teacher | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Usage

### Middleware Usage in Routes
```php
// Protect route by role
Route::get('/violations', [ViolationController::class, 'index'])->middleware('check.role:super_admin');

// Protect route by permission
Route::get('/violations', [ViolationController::class, 'index'])->middleware('check.permission:view_violations');
```

### Controller-Level Authorization
Currently implemented as inline checks in:
- `ViolationController->index()`: Filters by department for dept_heads
- `EmployeeController->index()`: Filters by department for dept_heads
- `ReportsController->getOverviewStatistics()`: Returns role-appropriate stats

## Testing the System

### Test Scenario 1: Super Admin Access
1. Login as Melanie Flores (super_admin)
2. Navigate to Violations list
3. Should see **ALL violations** from all departments
4. Dashboard should show **ALL statistics**

### Test Scenario 2: Department Head Access
1. Login as a Department Head (e.g., College of Engineering head)
2. Navigate to Violations list
3. Should see **ONLY violations** for their department's students
4. Dashboard should show **ONLY their department's statistics**
5. Employee list should show **ONLY their department's employees**

### Test Scenario 3: OSA Staff Access
1. Login as OSA staff member
2. Navigate to Violations list
3. Should see **ALL violations** (not restricted by department)
4. Dashboard should show **violations statistics only**

### Test Scenario 4: Create Violation with Levels
1. Navigate to Create Violation
2. Select each level option
3. Submit and verify saves correctly
4. Check violations list to see new level column with correct badge colors

## Security Notes

1. **Authorization Checks**: Implemented at controller level with inline checks. Can be moved to middleware for cleaner routes.
2. **Department-Based Access**: Controlled by `user->profile->department` field
3. **Role-Based Access**: Controlled by `user->role->name` field
4. **API Support**: Controllers check `$request->expectsJson()` for both view and API responses

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Move to Route Middleware**: Move authorization checks to route definitions
2. **Add Policy Classes**: Implement Laravel authorization policies for more granular control
3. **Add Audit Logging**: Track who accessed/modified what and when
4. **Add Department-Specific Dashboards**: Different dashboard layouts for different roles
5. **Add Bulk Operations**: Batch violation management for authorized users
